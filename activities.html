									<h2>Who I am</h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/microsoft.jpg" alt="" /></span>I was born and nurtured in Myitkyina, Kachin State, Myanmar.  My matriculation exam was successfully passed with Mathematics Destination in 2016, which was a big step in my academic career. I started my university studies in Mandalay the next year, in 2017, and I have since been passionately continuing my studies and working toward my goals there. It has been a very fulfilling experience for me to pursue a degree in computer science. I have a strong enthusiasm for this profession, and I always push myself to do my best in university.  I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to lead the Students' Union twice when I was a student. These positions helped me hone my leadership skills and gave me priceless experience leading teams and encouraging collaboration.I was in charge of organizing events and preparing a variety of university-related activities. My organizational and project management abilities have improved as a result of these experiences, ensuring the success of numerous initiatives.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/taxila.jpg" alt="" /></span>From August 2020 to January 2021, I interned at the Taxila Institute, a division of Taxila Education Group Limited. I completed assign works and projects on schedule, demonstrating an excellent commitment to my work. 
										I set off on a life-changing journey to Thailand in 2021 to complete my bachelor's degree at Rangsit University. The sad circumstances in my native country, where political unrest halted my university studies, led me to decide to complete my education in Thailand.
										<br>I bravely decided to change my major from Computer Science to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) while studying abroad in Thailand in order to better match my academic goals with my changing interests. This change gave me the opportunity to explore a wider range of technology-related subjects and gave me the versatility I required in our ever evolving digital environment.</p>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/rangsit activities.jpg" alt="" /></span>My experience at Rangsit University has been absolutely amazing. An amazing educational experience has been made possible by the caring academic community, committed teachers, and diverse student body. I have thrived in this dynamic environment, consistently developing my knowledge and abilities while establishing deep relationships with mentors and fellow students.My experiences at Rangsit University have increased my commitment to both academic and personal improvement in addition to igniting a newfound interest for technology. I am incredibly appreciative of the chances I've had and the consistent support I've had while I've been here, and I'm looking forward to making the most of these experiences as I continue to pursue my academic and professional goals.
